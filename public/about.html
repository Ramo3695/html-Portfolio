<p>I'm currently pursuing an online Software Engineering program at Grand Canyon University (GCU), 
  expected to take about a year and a half to complete. I'm a father and have a wife, and on my 
  free time, I enjoy smoking meats in my Traeger, exercising, playing video games, and challenging 
  myself to learn new skills. I am focused on building my expertise in software development while 
  balancing my family life and personal hobbies.</p>
